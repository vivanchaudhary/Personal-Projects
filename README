# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

## 📋 Project Description
The **Number Guessing Game** is a fun and interactive console-based game where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 100. The game tracks the number of attempts, calculates a score, and keeps track of the best score. Fewer attempts result in a higher score.

This project is implemented in **Python** and can be run from the terminal. It’s a great way to practice control flow, input handling, and loops in Python.
