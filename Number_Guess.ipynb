    "## üìã Project Description\n",
    "The **Number Guessing Game** is a fun and interactive console-based game where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 100. The game tracks the number of attempts, calculates a score, and keeps track of the best score. Fewer attempts result in a higher score.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is implemented in **Python** and can be run from the terminal. It‚Äôs a great way to practice control flow, input handling, and loops in Python.\n",

    "- Generates a **random number** between 1 and 100.\n",
    "- Tracks **number of attempts**.\n",
    "- Displays **Out of Bounds** error if a guess is outside the 1‚Äì100 range.\n",
    "- **Scoring system**: The fewer the attempts, the higher the score (Score = `100 - attempts`).\n",
    "- **Best score tracking** across multiple rounds (within the same execution).\n",
