## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Vivan**, a Math major with a Computer Science minor at **UIUC**. I have a passion for **software development**, **product design**, **data analysis**, and **music**. I’ve co-founded **Project Euphoria**, a non-profit initiative that provides educational materials to underprivileged children in Indonesia and India. Beyond academics, I love exploring tech projects that drive social impact and innovation.

I also enjoy working on **frontend and backend development**, participating in **coding competitions**, and creating meaningful software tools for everyday use. With a strong interest in **finance and machine learning**, I am currently building projects to predict stock prices and understand market trends.  

This repository showcases my coding journey—ranging from **data science experiments** to fun interactive **games**!
